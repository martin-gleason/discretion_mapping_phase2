# The Mapping Project

* Definition of Discretion: 
  + Discretion refers to the choices made by the officer when implementing
    - policy
    - practice
    - or referring to a program. 

* Scope

 + Limited to Probation and Court Services
 
 + Mapping areas of discretion
  - Not measuring the impact of discretion

# Discretion Mapping Team
* Composed of:
  + Two DCPOs
  + Four SPOs
  + Three field officers
  
* Started in February, 2017

* Completed phase one Feburary 22, 2018

# Visualizing Our Notes
```{r, wordcloud, include = TRUE, message=FALSE, echo =FALSE, error = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Visiualization of the 9 pages discretion mapping notes."}

  wordcloud(discretion_words$word, discretion_words$n, min.freq = 5, random.order = FALSE,
            random.color = FALSE, 
            color = pro_colors_scheme2,
            scale = c(4, 2 ))
```

# Results

* Approximately 45 discretion points through the system
  + Estimate stems from the ways discretion points can be measured
  
* Discretion points exist from detention screening to case termination

* Including *Objective Measures*
---
# Next Steps

* Determine an aspect to focus on
  + Pre-trial
  + Trial/Hearing
  + Services
  
* Clean Data
  + Audit of sources and storage
  + Follow best practices regarding 
     - Open Data
     - Data Science
