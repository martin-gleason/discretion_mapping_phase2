Github is a free service that allows for people to work on the same project. Because the Discretion Mapping Project will use a variety of methods to capture, transfrom, and analyze collected data, having one place to store all of our code and methods will allow for better communication and quality control.

None of the clients' identifiying information will be stored in Github. Methods to collect, anonymize, and analyize data will be stored here. Github and github pages will help commuicate concerns and findings to all stakeholders in the project.

While github is certainly not a tool utilized by most probation officers, we do need something to keep and distribute our work. While not every file needs to be on github, by keepig our methods, data, and finding on github, we are moving in a more open and transparent fashion to ensure that the work that this team does supports the field officers and the young people we serve.
