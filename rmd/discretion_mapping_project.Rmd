# Summary
The next phase of the discretion mapping project will be a deep dive into either pre-trial or case management, two of the categories that were established in the [first phase of the discretion mapping project.](https://martin-gleason.github.io/discretion-mapping/discretion_presentation.html#1) There is a third category, the trial phase, but that has been excluded due to limited ability for officers to have significant control or affect change during trials and hearings.

Both categories can have a significant impact on the court. To that end, the discretion points for each category are listed below. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has been conducted to help guide the discussion on the selection process. Neither the discretion points nor the CBA are meant to be complete. They are comprehensive and guide posts to additional discretion points, but the items are not weighted. The discussion stemming from these items will be the final deciding factor regarding next steps. 

## Recommendations
It is the recommendation of this officer that the second phase of the discretion mapping project focus on case management for the next 12-18 months, staffed by a total of 8 court staff. Half of the staff should come directly from C.O.R.E.

# Meta Factors
It should be noted that regardless of the focus area, this project will have to examine specific process questions; specifically, questions on how POs build rapport, interview families, conduct visits, summarize interactions, and present information to the court. It would be possible to do an entire project around these “meta” factors; however, lasting change maybe easier when these factors are examined within the context of their use.

# Cost/Benefit of Pre-Trial

## Costs:
* Bulk of field work is in Case Management
*  Changes in “pre-trial” work make comparing practice and policy difficult
* Pre-trial is not as historically important as case work
* Difficult to conceptualize due to Judges’ role
  * Judges like ordering pre-trial services even if there are no officers to provide those services

## Benefits:

• Appear to be the trend of court services
• Veteran POs who have experience case management as well as pre-trial can be good sources of info
• Still developing policy, practices, and philosophy may make culture change easier
• Less tasks in comparison to supervision means faster answers to CORE questions
• Size of units allow for easy evaluation of unit attitudes and “institutional knowledge”

# Cost/Benefit of Supervision
## Cost:
* More than 6x the discretion points of Pre-Trial means
  * Heavy lift
  * Many tasks mean lots of conceptualization
  * More planning for:
      * Interviews
      * Data evaluation
      * Analysis
* Field officers are already being scrutinized
  * RFK
  * DCPOs
  * JRA
  * Number of units/divisions means significant differences in
  * Institutional knowledge
  * Office-culture issues
  * Wide geographical areas
  * Without special considerations, buy-in from staff will be low due to the number of other initatives 

## Benefits:
* This is our “brand”
* Certain costs can be transformed into benefits:
  * Officers being scrutinized can be mitigated/transformed by CORE’s
    * Radical transparency
    * Regular and open communication
    * Acknowledgement of field difficulties
    * Pointed solutions
  * Significant areas of investigation mean the task can be deconstructed into smaller tasks
* High levels of difficult imply significant reward for completion
  * The return on this investment would be transformative to the entire department
