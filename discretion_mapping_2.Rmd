# Discretion Mapping: Recap
*  [Last  year, CORE presented findings on the discretion mapping project](https://martin-gleason.github.io/discretion-mapping/discretion_presentation.html)

  * A high level view of where an individual officer’s choice may have an impact on a minor

  * Categorized probation into three categories:
     *  Pre-trial
     *  Trial
     *  Case-management/Supervision

* A conservative estimate indicated 45 discretion points throughout the system
  
---
# Next Steps
.center[![](img/discretion_mapping.gif)]

* A new sub-committee made of CORE and non-CORE members.
* 12 - 18 month project 
* Deconstructing and analyzing
  * Case management and supervision 
  * Policy, practices, and programs through an equity lens
