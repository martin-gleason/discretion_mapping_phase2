# Discretion Mapping: Recap
*  [Last  year, CORE presented findings on the discretion mapping project](https://martin-gleason.github.io/discretion-mapping/discretion_presentation.html)

  * A high level view of where an individual officerâ€™s choice may have an impact on a minor

  * Categorized probation into three categories:
     *  Pre-trial
     *  Trial
     *  Case-management/Supervision

* An extremely conservative estimate indicated 45 discretion points through the system

# Next Steps

* A new committee made of CORE and non-CORE members.
* 12 - 18 month long project 
* Deconstructing and analyzing
  * Case management and supervision 
  * Policy, practices, and programs through an equity lens

# Focus: Case Management
.pull-left[
* Regarded as the central aspect of field work

* Not the first, or last, step in this section

* Multiple steps
  *  Some structured, some unstructured
  
* Complex

* Data rich

# Methods
.pull-left[
* **Create the map:**
  * Deconstruct each "box"
      * Map each step to determine:
          * What we can measure
              * Factors in each step
              * Data we have
              * Data we want
          * Policies and procedures for each step]

.pull-right[* **Document the map:**
  * In a [real database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
  * Anonymize PO and Client Data
  * Will allow for multiple users to:
      * Document
      * Analyze
      * Transform data
      * Easily communicate findings]
