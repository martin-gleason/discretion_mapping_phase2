# Discretion Mapping: Recap
*  [Last  year, CORE presented findings on the discretion mapping project](https://martin-gleason.github.io/discretion-mapping/discretion_presentation.html)

  * A high level view of where an individual officerâ€™s choice may have an impact on a minor
  
  * An extremely conservative estimate indicated 45 discretion points through the system

* The next step is to back a 1 year to 18 month internal examination of case management and supervisor strategies with regard to discretion points

# Discretion Mapping: Next Steps
