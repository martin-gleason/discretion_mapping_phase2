# Discretion Mapping: Recap
*  [Last  year, CORE presented findings on the discretion mapping project](https://martin-gleason.github.io/discretion-mapping/discretion_presentation.html)

  * A high level view of where an individual officerâ€™s choice may have an impact on a minor

  * Categorized probation into three categories:
     *  Pre-trial
     *  Trial
     *  Case-management/Supervision

* A conservative estimate indicated 45 discretion points throughout the system
  
---
# Next Steps
.center[![](img/discretion_mapping.gif)]

* A new sub-committee made of CORE and non-CORE members.
* 12 - 18 month project 
* Deconstructing and analyzing
  * Case management and supervision 
  * Policy, practices, and programs through an equity lens

* Regarded as the central aspect of field work</br> </br>
* Not the first, or last, step in this framework</br> </br>
* Data rich
  * Documents

* The task is to identify:
  * Data-sources
  * Discretion Points
  * Potential outcomes]

# Methods: Radical Transparency

*In order to cut through the noise of other projects, initiatives, and roll-outs, this team will have to be clear, constant, and consistent in communicating our data, methods, successes and failures with the department.*

### Methods: Communication Plan
Meeting Structure

  * [Agile](https://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) informed

### Methods: Database Discussion

* Currently, the department stores, transforms, and shares data in Spreadsheets

* By using a database, we can:
  * Have a more secure solution
  * Work the data without fear of losing the data
  * Make our data available so others can reproduce our work

* Our current data practices prevent the development of insight and actionable steps

* Using a database will force the department to evolve in a more equitable direction
